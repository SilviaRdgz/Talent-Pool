A React App as final project of the Web Development course at Ironhack, 2021.

TechMeUp (TMU) is a tech fund which supported my tech training. Inspired by their mission and their trust, I wanted to give them something back and, in recirprocitty, support their growth.

Talent Pool is site to give extra exposure to the talent funded by TMU, making them more visible to tech recruiters.
